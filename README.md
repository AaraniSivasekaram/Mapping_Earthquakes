# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
This challenge and module introduced us to Leaflet, GeoJSON data and Mapbox. In this module we enhanced maps by adding earthquakes with indicators marking magnitude of the quakes. Throughout the deliverables of this challenge we:
1. Added tectonic plate data through lines and map layers, 
2. Added major (magnitude of 4+) earthquake data through layers and different coloured indicators, and 
3. Added some additional maps through Mapbox's styling features.

## Result
The challenge's end result included an interactive map with many layers, style and lots of important earthquake information: ![Satellite Map with Tectonic Plates and Major Earthquakes](https://github.com/AaraniSivasekaram/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/Satellite%20Map%20with%20Tectonic%20Plates%20and%20Major%20Earthquakes.png)
